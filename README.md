Hello Folks!

This is a simple card game using JavaScript.

The game is played with the following simple rules:

1. If the sum of your card numbers is exactly 21, then you win the game.
2. If the sum of your card numbers is less than 21, you can draw a new card.
3. If the sum of your card numbers exceeds 21, you lose the game.

Let's play and have fun!

I used simple CSS for styling the content. I incorporated a black color for button hover, which enhances the game's appearance and gives it an elegant look.
